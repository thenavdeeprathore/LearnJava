 * Variable Program 02: Types of Variables
 * 
 * There are 3 types of variables
 * 1) Instance Variable
 * 2) Static Variable
 * 3) Local Variable
 * Today we will discuss second type which is STATIC Variables in Java.

class Var_02 {

    /*
     * IMPORTANT POINTS:
     * 
     * Static variables are also known as Class variables
     * 
     * a) As static variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
     * b) Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
     * c) Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0.
     * d) Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
     * e) If we access the static variable without the class name, Compiler will automatically append the class name.
     * f) If we access the static variable like Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it wonâ€™t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name to class name automatically.
