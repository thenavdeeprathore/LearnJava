     * 
     * public static void main(String[] args)
     * 
     * public: So that JVM can execute the method from anywhere. 
     * static: Main method is to be called without object. 
     *         The modifiers public and static can be written in either order. 
     * void: The main method doesn't return anything.
     * main(): Name configured in the JVM. 
     * String[]: The main method accepts a single argument: an array of elements of type String.
