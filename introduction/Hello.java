     * IMPORTANT POINTS:
     * 
     * Q1) Can we run or print message without main method?
     * Answer: NO, from JDK7 onwards main method is mandatory.
     * 
     * Q2) Does JVM create object of Hello class (the class with main())?
     * Answer: N0, the reason for main() static in Java is to make sure that the main() can be called without any instance
